# 🎯 Alphabet Guessing Game (Python)

A simple command-line game where the player must enter a word that starts with a randomly generated alphabet letter. The game runs for 10 rounds and gives instant feedback for each attempt.

## 📌 Features

* Random alphabet generation each round
* 10 total rounds of gameplay
* Instant correct/incorrect feedback
* Beginner-friendly Python project
* Uses built-in Python libraries only

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 
* No external libraries needed (uses `random` and `string`, which are built-in)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Copy the code into a file named `alphabet_game.py`
